# CALCULUS USING MATLAB 
A bunch of MATLAB code files used for solving common calculus problems.

<br/>

## Area under curve
Calculates the area between two curves and plots it in a graph.

**Input**
* function of the upper curve in terms of x
* function of the lower curve in terms of x

**Output**
* Area between the curves
* Graph representing the curves

<br/>

## Tangent of curve at origin.
Finds the equation of the tangent of a curve at the origin (0,0).

**Input**
* function of the curve in terms of x
* function of the curve in terms of x (extra input)

**Output**
* Equation of the tangents in functions of x
* Graph representing the curves and the tangents

##### **Note:** The code can be modified to get tangents at any point. 

<br/>

## Local maxima/minima of one vvariable functions
Finds the points where the functions is minimum or maximum and and evaluates the function's value

**Input**
* function of the curve in terms of x

**Output**
* Displays if the critical points is a maxima or minima 
* Displays the value of the maxima or minima
* Displays the point where maxima or minima occurs (value of x and y)
* Graph of the curve and its extrema

<br/>

## Maxima/minima of two variable functions
Finds the maxima and minima of functions of two variables (surface)

**Input**
* function of two variables (equation of surface) in terms of x and y

**Output**
* Displays if the critical points where the function is a maxima or minima (x,y) 
* Displays the value of the maxima or minima
* Graph of the surface and the extremas

<br/>

## Maxima/Minima using Langrange multiplier method
Finds the maximas and minimas of two variable functions (surfaces) using Langrange Multiplier method.

**Input**
* function of two variables (equation of surface) in terms of x and y

**Output**
* Displays if the critical points is a maxima or minima and point where it occurs (x,y) 
* Displays the value of the maxima or minima
* Graph of the surface and the extremas

##### **Note:** Gives the same answer as previous code, just a different method

<br/>

## Volume of solid obtained by revolving a curve around an axis
Finds the volume of the solid obtained by revolving a curve (one variable function) around an axis

**Input**
* function of two variables (equation of surface) in terms of x and y

**Output**
* Displays the volume obtained by revolving the curve around y-axis
* Graph of the solid whose volume was obtained
